# TimeSeriesPrediction
Comparing model performance in time series prediction


## Motivation
There is a lot of time series prediction involved in my work, especially in cases where long-term future values are predicted based on short-term historical data (e.g., using 30 days of data to predict the next 700 days). I want to have a place to store and compare different types of ML models. I will start with univariate time series prediction and potentially include more scenarios.



## Data and Metrics



## Models
Here is a list of models(ongoing):
- [Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)(as baseline)
- LSTM
- LLM
- ...
